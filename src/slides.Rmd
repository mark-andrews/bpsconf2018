## How we usually work

When carrying out computing/data-analysis intensive scientific research, the following is the common *modus operandi*:

- Interactive processing, analysis, and visualization of data. 
- Copying-and-pasting values and figures into reports. 
- The report, and not the data and code, is then made public.

## Problems with the traditional approach

- Interactive work, followed by copying-and-pasting results is inherently error prone.
- It is also highly inefficient; even small changes become prohibitively expensive.
- The workflow is not reproducible; the details of the pipeline from raw data to reported results are not recorded.
- The reported results are not transparent; the public views only a carefully selected facade.
- Data and code are separated from the report and remain hidden. Data and code are the second class citizens of scientific communication.

## Doing open, reproducible, and transparent analysis

The following are some of the tools that can greatly facilitate open, reproducible, and transparent analysis:

- RMarkdown
- Knitr
- pandoc
- packrat
- Jupyter notebooks
- pip \& virtual environments
- Git
- GitHub
- Git fat, Git annex, Git LFS
- VirtualBox, Docker, Vagrant, etc.

## RMarkdown: Example 1

We write source code that is mixture of R code and explanatory text that optionally references the R variables.

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(htmltools::includeText("example-chunk-1.Rmd"))
```

## RMarkdown: Example 1 (rendered)

When we render this, we'll produce a document (in this case, \LaTeX) with both the code and any output and any evaluated variables in the text.

```{r, child = 'example-chunk-1.Rmd'}
```


## RMarkdown: Example 2

We may turn off the rendering of the R source code with `echo = FALSE`. 

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(htmltools::includeText("example-chunk-2.Rmd"))
```

## RMarkdown: Example 2 (rendered)

Then we get e.g. just the rendered text, but not the R *chunk*.

```{r, child = 'example-chunk-2.Rmd'}
```


## RMarkdown: Example 3

Figures will be rendered and inserted into the document in an identical manner.

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(htmltools::includeText("example-chunk-3.Rmd"))
```

## RMarkdown: Example 3 (rendered)


```{r, child = 'example-chunk-3.Rmd'}
```


## RMarkdown: Example 4

Likewise, tables from statistical models can be rendered and inserted into the document.

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(htmltools::includeText("example-chunk-4.Rmd"))
```

## RMarkdown: Example 4 (rendered)


```{r, child = 'example-chunk-4.Rmd'}
```


## RMarkdown: Example 5

RMarkdown allows us to typeset mathematical equations, symbols, etc., just as we would do with \LaTeX.

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(htmltools::includeText("example-chunk-5.Rmd"))
```

## RMarkdown: Example 4 (rendered)


```{r, child = 'example-chunk-5.Rmd'}
```

## RMarkdown, knitr, pandoc, papaja

- RMarkdown is basically a combination of a *Markdown* document with embedded R code that is evaluated by [`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr/).

- The resulting file is processed by pandoc to produce the desired output file type. 

- The three main output options are 
    - pdf from \LaTeX
    - MS Word
    - HTML 
    
- Tools like [`papaja`](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) allow us to create APA formatted manuscripts from RMarkdown.

- `knitr` can also be combined directly with \LaTeX, and this allows even more control of the final document. 



## Jupyter notebooks

* Jupyter notebook are browser-based *live* or *dynamic* documents.
* They are ideal for interactive work, prototype code development, visualization.
* They generate rendered documents, e.g. pdf via \LaTeX, html, etc, like RMarkdown.
* Jupyter notebooks support multiple languages, but began as an extension of the IPython project, and Python is probably the most widely used language. 

See demo available at https://try.jupyter.org

## Git \& GitHub

* Git is version control software, initially developed for version control of the Linux operating system kernel.
* It is now extremely widely used for almost all kinds of software development projects. 
* Git works on a decentralized system whereby a code-base can be *cloned*, developed independently, and possible re-merged. 
* For collaborating on one project, two developers use a *remote* host, clone it, develop locally, *commit* and then *push* back to and *pull* from the remote host.
* GitHub is one of the most widely used hosting sites (but there are others, e.g. BitBucket; and running your own git hosting server is simple and inexpensive).
* Git is designed for source code (i.e. text files) management. Data and other "assets" can be attached to (rather than kept within) the repository using `git fat`, `git annex`, `git lfs`, etc.

## Git: Tiny tutorial

- Start by cloning a remote repository:
```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
      git clone https://github.com/yihui/knitr.git
      cd knitr
      git log # Read all the commit logs
```
- Work as normal, i.e. edit files, create new files, delete files. 
- You now *stage* your changes, e.g.
```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
      git add foo.file.1 foo.file.2 # for edits or new files
      git rm foo.file.3 # for removed files
```
- You then *commit* these:
```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
      git commit # Editor opens for your log msg
```


## Git: Tiny tutorial (2)

- Pull down any recent changes by others from the remote:
```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
      git pull
      git log # If new changes, read their logs
```
- Now, push your own changes to the remote
```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
      git push # requires permissions
```

- Undo changes:
```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
      git reset a381f2f # move back "head"
      git revert a381f2f # applies new change to revert 
```

## Conclusions

- For open, transparent, and reproducible analysis, the code, data, and explanatory texts must be remain coupled. 
- RMarkdown (and knitr) and Jupyter notebooks are two complementary approaches to coupling data, code, and explanatory text. 
- Git \& GitHub allows us to manage, develop, and share these interdependent files.
